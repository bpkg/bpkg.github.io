## bpkg is a _bash package manager_

_JavaScript has [npm][npm], Ruby has [Gems][gem], Python has [pip][pip] and now Shell has bpkg!_

With **bpkg** you can easily install and manage Bash packages.

It takes care of installing/uninstalling, execution permissions and everything so you can simply do the following:

{% highlight bash %}
# Installs `term` on `/usr/local/bin` (https://github.com/bpkg/term)
$ bpkg install term -g
$ term
{% endhighlight %}

Besides installing shell scripts globally you can use them on a _per-project basis_.

{% highlight bash %}
# Installs `term` under the `deps/` directory
$ bpkg install term
$ ./deps/term/term.sh
{% endhighlight %}

## Install

You can install **bpkg** from 3 methods:

### 1. Install Script

Our custom install script will take care of everything for you.
Just paste the following on your shell:

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl -sLo- http://get.bpkg.sh | bash
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to see what's inside it, [access it directly](http://get.bpkg.sh) or [check it out on the repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bpkg/bpkg/master/setup.sh).

### 2. clibs

{% endhighlight %}

### 3. Source Code

If you prefer to handle source code, clone **bpkg**'s repository and install it on the following way:
