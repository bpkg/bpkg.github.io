## Package details

Here we lay down some info on the structure of a package.

## bpkg.json

Every package must have a file called `bpkg.json`; it specifies package metadata on the [JSON format][json].
(For legacy reasons, this file may also be called `package.json`).

Here's an example of a well-formed `bpkg.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "term",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Terminal utility functions",
  "scripts": [ "term.sh" ],
  "install": "make install"
}
```

All fields are mandatory except when noted.
Here's a detailed explanation on all fields:

### name

The `name` attribute is required as it is used to tell `bpkg` where to put it in the `deps/` directory in you project.

```json
  "name": "my-script"
```

### version (optional)

The `version` attribute is not required but can be useful. It should correspond to the version that is associated with the installed package.

```json
  "version": "0.0.1"
```

### description

A human readable description of what the package offers for functionality.

```json
  "description": "This script makes monkeys jump out of your keyboard"
```

### global

Indicates that the package is only intended to be installed as a script. This allows the omission of the `-g` or `--global` flag during installation.

```json
  "global": "true"
```

### install

Shell script used to invoke in the install script. This is required if the `global` attribute is set to `true` or if the `-g` or `--global` flags are provided.

```json
  "install": "make install"
```

### scripts

This is an array of scripts that will be installed into a project.

```json
  "scripts": ["script.sh"]
```

### files (optional)

This is an array of non-script files that will be installed into a project.

```json
  "files": ["bar.txt", "foo.txt"]
```

### dependencies (optional)

This is a hash of dependencies. The keys are the package names, and the values are the version specifiers. If you want the latest code use `'master'` in the version specifier. Otherwise, use a tagged release identifier. This works the same as `bpkg install`'s package/version specifiers.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "term": "0.0.1"
  }
```

### dependencies-dev (optional)

This is a hash of dependencies only needed during development.  Like the `dependencies` array, the keys are the package names, and the values are the version specifiers; `'master'` or a tagged release can be used as the identifier. These development dependencies are installed by adding the `-d` or `--dev` flags to the `bpkg install` command.

```json
  "dependencies-dev": {
    "term": "0.0.1"
  }
```

### commands (optional)

This is a hash of commands. The keys are the names of the commands and the values are the commands to execute in a shell.  The commands can be called from the command line with `bpkg run` followed by the command name.

```json
  "commands": {
    "say-hello": "echo \"Hello $1\""
  }
```

The commands are run with `eval`, which runs the command as if on the command line. Commands can contain environment variables, and supports [shell features] (including *[special parameters]* and *[shell expansions]*). Passed parameters (on the command line after the command name) can be accessed in the command by using `$@` or `$1`.

```bash
$ bpkg run say-hello "Bash Package Manager"
Hello Bash Package Manager
```

### commands-description (optional)

This is a hash of descriptions for configured commands.  The keys are the names of the commands and the values are the descriptions for the specified commands.  The command descriptions can be listed on the command line by providing the `-l` or `--list` flags after the `bpkg run` command.

```json
  "commands-description": {
    "say-hello": "Output hello to provided name (ex: bpkg run say-hello John)"
  }
```

## Packaging best practices

These are guidelines that we strongly encourage developers to follow.

### Package exports

It's nice to have a bash package that can be used in the terminal and also be invoked as a command line function. To achieve this the exporting of your functionality *should* follow this pattern:

```sh
if [[ ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} != $0 ]]; then
  export -f my_script
else
  my_script "${@}"
  exit $?
fi
```

This allows a user to `source` your script or invoke as a script.

```sh
# Running as a script
$ ./my_script.sh some args --blah
# Sourcing the script
$ source my_script.sh
$ my_script some more args --blah
```
