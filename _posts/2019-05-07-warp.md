Tired of figuring out the relative path to a file, so you can copy it?
Tire no more! Warp is a small bash tool to move or copy a file from one location to another.

## Basic Usage

To copy a file in a directory in one terminal, to the directory of another terminal, first warp in the file
```
warp in foo.txt
```
In the other terminal, warp copy it
```
warp cp .
```
