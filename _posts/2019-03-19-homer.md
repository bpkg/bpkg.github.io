Homer is a "home directory manager" for your shell. It turns your home
directory into a Git repository with most files excluded by default, and
includes some command-line tools for managing that repo from anywhere in
your shell. Homer also provides a series of conventions for making your
shell life a lot easier. It's written in ZSH.
