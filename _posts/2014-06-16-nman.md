This package adds the convenience of man pages to [the node.js API](http://nodejs.org/api/).

{% highlight bash %}
$ bpkg install nman -g
{% endhighlight %}

## Usage

Just use `nman` along with the node API you'd like to view.
Some examples:

{% highlight bash %}
# For the File System module
$ nman fs

# ...and the console
$ nman console

# The name is the same as you'd `require` it
# For the "Assertion Testing", just like you
# would `require(assert)`, do...
$ nman assert
{% endhighlight %}

*NOTE:* It requires _an active internet connection_. It does not come with the docs nor stores offline as they are requested.
