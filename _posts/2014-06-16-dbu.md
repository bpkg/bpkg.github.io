`dbu` (Dropbox Uploader) is a BASH script which can be used to upload, download, list or delete files from Dropbox, an online file sharing, synchronization and backup service.

It's written in BASH scripting language and only needs **cURL**.

**Why use this script?**

* **Portable:** It's written in BASH scripting and only needs *cURL* (curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, available for all operating systems and installed by default in many linux distributions).
* **Secure:** It's not required to provide your username/password to this script, because it uses the official Dropbox API for the authentication process.

Please refer [to the Wiki](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/wiki) for tips and additional information about this project. The Wiki is also the place where you can share your scripts and examples related to Dropbox Uploader.

{% highlight bash %}
$ bpkg install -g dbu
{% endhighlight %}

## Usage

The `dbu` package comes with two executables - `dropbox_uploader.sh` and `dropShell.sh`.

### Dropbox Uploader

This script receives commands, pretty much like `git`. The syntax is quite simple:

```
dropbox_uploader.sh COMMAND [PARAMETERS]...

[%%]: Optional param
<%%>: Required param
```

#### Available commands

* **upload** <LOCAL_FILE/DIR ...> <REMOTE_FILE/DIR>
  Upload a local file or directory to a remote Dropbox folder.
  If the file is bigger than 150Mb the file is uploaded using small chunks (default 4Mb);
  in this case a . (dot) is printed for every chunk successfully uploaded and a * (star) if an error occurs (the upload is retried for a maximum of three times).
  Only if the file is smaller than 150Mb, the standard upload API is used, and if the -p option is used
  the default curl progress bar is displayed during the upload process.
  The local file/dir parameter supports wildcards expansion.
* **download** <REMOTE_FILE/DIR> [LOCAL_FILE/DIR]
  Download file or directory from Dropbox to a local folder
