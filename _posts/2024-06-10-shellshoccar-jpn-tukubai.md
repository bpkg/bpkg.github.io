This is shellscript implementation of usp Tukubai.

Most of their commands work for line-record space-separated text files.

## Some commands
`self` selects specified fields.

`zen` and `han` convert katakana and alphanumeric characters on specified fields into zenkaku and hankaku respectively.

`sm2`, `sm4` and `sm5` report your business.

`keta` aligns your data.
